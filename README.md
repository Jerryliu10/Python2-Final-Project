# Python2-Final-Project
 

This is a interactive dash project showing Covid-19 cases and death rate in United States.

This project uses an interactive bar plot to show Covid cases. User can filter data by simply entering conditions in the panel. e.g. enter >50000 in box below cases.

Also, each barplot is segmented according to county. Therefore, users can easily find out which county has the most cases and are able to further examine it by filtering the data to the state it belongs to.
